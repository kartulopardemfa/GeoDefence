**Last Updated:** October 26, 2023

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Umay Edin & Ã–mer Kaya ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the GeoDefense: Crown Guard application (the "App").

Our commitment is to your privacy. This App is designed as a simple game and **does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users.**

## Information We Do Not Collect
The App does not collect any of the following:

*   Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, address, email address, or phone number.
*   Device identifiers or specific device information (beyond what is anonymously provided by the App Store for crash reporting, if applicable, which is not accessed or stored by us directly).
*   Location data.
*   Usage data or analytics about how you play the game (e.g., scores are stored locally on your device only and are not transmitted to us).
*   Data from third-party services or accounts.

## Data Storage
Any game-related data, such as high scores or game progress, is stored locally on your Apple Watch and/or companion iOS device. This data is not transmitted to us or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect your personal data through the App.

## Children's Privacy
Since we do not collect any personal data, the App is safe for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us, and we will ensure it is addressed appropriately, though the App is designed not to collect such information in the first place.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
